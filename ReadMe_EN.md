About KeepLink
==
KeepLink is a very generic __Mind Mapping / Concept Mapping__ application.    
It can therefore - potentially - be applied from __numerous different domains__.   
(as long as the essence of the domain can be represented by __Items__ linked by __Links__)   
=> So it's covered on wide horizons ;-)

Examples of "Personal" applications
-
* Do To List (Purchase, Travel, ...)
* Home Management
* Networking
* Genealogical "Tree"
* Media library
* Wine cellar management
* ...

Examples of "Pro" applications
-
* Business Process Mapping
* Application Mapping
* Getting Things Done (GTD) approach *
* Ecosystem Mapping
* Entrepreneurial approach of the type " Performing " 
* PLM "ligth"
* ...

Examples - not exhaustive - of supported functions
-
* Intuitive creation of Items and Links
* Default bi-directional links (with semantics adapted to each meaning)
* Systematic reification of Links (because in KL all Links are - also - Items)
* Easy transformation of an Item into a Type
* Possibility to define Link Types
* Association of Property (as much as necessary) to Items (and therefore also to Links ;-)
* An Item can belong to several Types (Multi-Typing)
* The same knowledge base can be viewed via several different models (Multi-Modelling)
> Therefore the same set of Items can be viewed from the angle of different Models (Set of Item Type and Link Type)
* Possibility to perform calculations with the Numerical Properties ...   
... and to propagate the results along the links of a particular semantics
* Abolition of the classical "system" / "model" / "user" boundaries (which allows "user" items to reference "model" (or even "system") elements)
* Collaboration in asynchronous mode (via sending / receiving "Package")
* Soon: Multi-device synchronization (And synchronous collaboration / Sharing)

Note
-
For "power-users": Many advanced features can be unlocked via "Easter Eggs".
