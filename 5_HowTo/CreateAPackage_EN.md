How To Create a Package ?
==

KeepLink allows you to create different types of :
* "Collaborative" Package
* Package "Static"
* "One-Off" package

Note: The user level required is not the same for all package types.   
> You will find <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/KeepLink/blob/master/5_HowTo/ChangeUserLevel_FR.md">here</a> instructions for changing the user level.

Package "Collaborative"
-
The characteristics of this type of Package are as follows: 
* Required user level: Normal
* Menu location: Click on an item => "Share Item ..." menu. / "Create a collaborative Item"
* Definition mode: Adding Items one after the other
* Mode of realization: With each "Build", a "Delta" is created.
* Mode of use: The person who receives the Package can add new Items, but also delete existing Items (=> BUT this will delete them from all collaborators, including the issuer of the Package when applying updates)
* Advanced: Ability to specify the inclusion of a "Static" package

Package "Static"
-
The characteristics of this type of Package are as follows: 
* Required user level: Packager
* Menu location: Menu "Settings" / "Packages" => Button "+"
* Mode of definition: Via a "recipe" based on "included" and/or "excluded" Items (and "levels" of consideration)
* Mode of realization: At each "Build", all the Items are regenerated.
* How to use: Whoever receives the Items can NOT delete them individually (=> He can just "uninstall" the whole Package).

One-Off Package

The characteristics of this type of Package are as follows: 
* TO-BE-COMPLETED
